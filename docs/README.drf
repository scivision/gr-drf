The gr_drf module is useful for interacting with HDF5 files in the
Digital RF format. To use the gr_drf blocks, the Python namespace is
in 'gr_drf', which is imported as:

    import gr_drf

See the Doxygen documentation for details about the blocks available
in this package. A quick listing of the details can be found in Python
after importing by using:

    help(gr_drf)
